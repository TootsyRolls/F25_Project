# F25 Project : 8-Ball Simulator 🎱
This is our simple 8-Ball Simulator complete with a physics system and ajustable parameters!
You can shoot the balls around the table and watch them bouncing around.
You can also modify the environment by increasing its friction or by modifying the mass of the balls!
## User's Guide ℹ
